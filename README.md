What is Musica?

Musica is a music related web application built with MEVN(MongoDb, Express, Vue, NodeJs) stack. The idea behind Musica is to give music lovers a platform where they can transform youtube files into Mp3s and save them to their music library.

Why Musica?

Suppose you are listening to youtune and you come accross a song you never heard before and you have no idea about the song title or the arrist but you really like the song. It may happen that you will forget about the song title or the artist name and you may never again be able to hear the song. I know you can bookmark the song but bookmarks can be deleted. In Musica you can simply copy the youtube song url and paste it to your add song section and simply download it in mp3 format and save it to your music library. From there you can listen to the song anytime you want and also you can download the song in your computer. Soon there will be an option by which you can share other users songs in Musica and save those songs to your library.

Technology Used: MongoDb, Express, Vue, NodeJs, JWT for authentication.
